<font size=-1> <b><i>Xuemin Lin </i></b> is a chair professor in the Department of Data and Business Intelligence at the Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and currently the head of Department of Data and Business Intelligence. Prof Lin is a foreign member of Academia Europaea and a fellow of IEEE.
     Xuemin got his PhD in <i>Computer Science</i> from the
<a href="http://www.uq.edu.au"> University of Queensland </a> (Australia) in 1992 and his
BSc in Applied Math from
<a href="http://www.fudan.edu.cn"> Fudan University </a> (China) in 1984.
During 1984-1988, he studied for PhD in Applied Math at Fudan University.

<p align=justify>
Xuemin started his teaching in the Computer Science Department
at the <a href="http://www.uwa.edu.au"> University of Western Australia </a>
in Nov 1994 after a 2 years research fellow appointment at the University
of Queensland. He joined
 the School of
Computer Science and Engineering at the University of New South Wales in Nov 1997.
In 2005, he was a visiting researcher in Microsoft Asia Research Lab and visited Tokyo
University as a JSPS fellow. He is a distinguished visiting Professor at Tsinghua University and a visiting Chair Professor at Fudan University. He has been an adiunct Professor at East Normal University, Zhejiang Gongshang University, and Guangzhou University.  
Xuemin currently is the Editor-in-Chief  of IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering. 
an Associate Editor-in-Chief of IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering. 
He was an associate editor of <a href="http://tods.acm.org/"> ACM Transactions on Database Systems </a> (2008-2014) and
an associate editor of <a href="http://www.computer.org/portal/web/tkde/about"> IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering</a> (2013 Feb - 2015 Jan).
<p align=justify>
His teaching covered a quite range of courses at different
leveles. He also supervised many graduate students. 
Xuemin Lin's principal research areas  are <i> databases </i> and
<i> graph visualisation </i>.
<ul>
<li>
<p align=justify>
In <i>databases</i>, his research areas include data mining, data streams,
distributed database systems, spatial database systems, and web databases.
Currently, he is
working on <i> data streams,</i>, <i>approximate query processing</i>,
<i>spatial data processing </i>, <i>probabilistic queries</i>,  <i> Graph Databases </i>, and <i>web information processing</i>.

<li>
<p align=justify> <i>Graph visualisation</i> is to display a graph according to the aesthetics from
applications; for example, one may wish to draw a graph symmetrically if
possible. Graph visualisation serves as a tool in many applications. A number
of topics have been covered by Xuemin in graph drawing, which include drawing
<i>trees</i>, <i>undirected graphs</i>, <i>directed graphs</i>, and
<i>hierarchical graphs</i>. Xuemin's main
focus has been on understanding inherent difficulties of drawing problems, and then
developing effective drawing algorithms. </font>
