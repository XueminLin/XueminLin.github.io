The project aims to effectively support data processing in large-scale, graph-based applications. The computation of graph-based aggregates/statistics is fundamental to a wide range of real applications. In this project, we will develop, analyse, implement, and evaluate novel techniques to efficiently process aggregates over massive graphs. Specifically, we will develop novel techniques to summarize various statistics against massive graphs for query processing optimization and on-line data analysis. We will also support the applications where graphs may be dynamically updated.
